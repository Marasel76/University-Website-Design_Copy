                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
                    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                    JavaScript.</p>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's used to add style to a web page by dictating how a
                    site is displayed on a browser. CSS is unique in that it doesn't create any new elements, like HTML
                    or JavaScript. Instead, it's a language used to style HTML elements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
                    multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else</p>

                <p>Itâ€™s well known that people like to gather where food is served. Despite the many other
                    comfortable
                    rooms at a house party, the kitchen is oftentimes the most crowded space. And the college

                    is no exception. Improved effectiveness begins by understanding that food service spaces are
                    typically used for a wide variety of important functions. A contemporary design acknowledges
                    this,
                    transforming the traditional cafeteria into a multi-purpose space that can perform the following
                    roles vital to the higher education experience: </p>
