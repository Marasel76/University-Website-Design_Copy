                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
                    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                    JavaScript.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's used to add style to a web page by dictating how a
                    site is displayed on a browser. CSS is unique in that it doesn't create any new elements, like HTML
                    or JavaScript. Instead, it's a language used to style HTML elements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
                    multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else</p>

                    August,
                    provided the perfect opportunity to celebrate!

                    Work is underway to prepare our campus for our new West Slope development and with the old
                    playground and basketball court falling within the West Slope development area, their relocation
                    presented a great opportunity to enhance our facilities by providing new play and sports
                    equipment
                    and upgrading the environment around them.

                <h3>Testy and Healthy Food</h3>
                <p>Itâ€™s well known that people like to gather where food is served. Despite the many other
                    comfortable
                    rooms at a house party, the kitchen is oftentimes the most crowded space. And the college
                    cafeteria
                    is no exception. Improved effectiveness begins by understanding that food service spaces are
                    typically used for a wide variety of important functions. A contemporary design acknowledges
                    this,
                    transforming the traditional cafeteria into a multi-purpose space that can perform the following
                    roles vital to the higher education experience: </p>
